    <!-- Do-While Loop
When to use: When you want the loop to execute at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true at first.
How to use:
The code block executes once before the condition is evaluated.
If the condition is true, it will continue looping.
Example: Asking the user for input at least once before validation.

javascript
Copy code
let number;
do {
  number = prompt("Enter a number greater than 10:");
} while (number <= 10);
Summary:

For loop: Use when iterations are predetermined.
While loop: Use when the loop should continue until a condition changes dynamically.
Do-while loop: Use when you need the code block to run at least once, even if the condition is false initially. -->
