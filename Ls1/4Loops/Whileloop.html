    <!-- Syntax
    while(condition){
        lines of code to be executed
    } 
    -->

    <!-- While Loop
    When to use: When you want to repeat a block of code until a specific condition becomes false, but you don't necessarily know how many iterations you'll need.
    How to use:
    The condition is checked before each iteration.
    The loop will run as long as the condition is true.
    Example: Looping until user input is valid.
    ex Code:-                    -->
    <!-- <script>
        let userInput = '';
        while (userInput !== 'stop') {
        userInput = prompt('Enter text, type "stop" to end:');
        }
    </script> -->

    <script>
      var count = 5;
      while (count < 12) {
        document.write(count + "<br>");
        count++;
      }
    </script>

    <!-- while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10. -->
    <script>
      document.write("while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.<br>");
      var num = 1;
      while (num <= 10) {
        document.write(num + "<br>");
        num++;
      }
    </script>

    <!-- while loop to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 -->
    <script>
      document.write(
        "while loop to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 <br>"
      );
      let i = 1;
      let sum = 0;

      while (i <= 100) {
        sum += i;
        i++;
      }
      document.write("Sum: " + sum+"<br>");
    </script>

    <!-- while loop that prints the even numbers between 1 and 20. -->
     <script>

        var se=0;
        while(se<20){
